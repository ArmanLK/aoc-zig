my 2023 advent of code in zig

## Some Help
The general idea of running is that I pipe a cat result of my puzzle input into my program.
For running part 1 uncomment part1() and comment part2() in main function of the day.
You can also cat both puzzle files and uncomment both of them

I'm always a day or more off and I probably not gonna complete the challenge
